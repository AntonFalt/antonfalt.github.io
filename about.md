I am a 26 year old fella that lives in Växjö and studies computer science at Linneus University.
To be able to handle my private life i chose to a distance education, which fits me nicely. 
My main interests are to spend time with my small family (fiancée + dog), friends and gaming.

Since previously I have a bachelor in business administration, also from Linneus University. 
As I commited to this program as well, I guess one could say I enjoy studying and is keen to learn.
Besides studying right now I also work as an advisor at an insurance company.
This setup works fine so far as both my work and studies are rather flexible.

My plan for the future is to complete this program and then to work as a programmer.
As I would be rather comfortable with running a company considering my background within economics,
it is possible that I would at some point start my own business. 

Time will tell, but I believe that there are exiting times ahead!
